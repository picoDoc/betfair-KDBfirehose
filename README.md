betfair-KDBfirehose
===================

So the point of the project is to build a kdb+ database stack using the torq framework to capture,store and query realtime betting market data from betfair.com through the betfair API-NG. Betting data pretty similar to market data, so it's a good use case for kdb+.

This project has moved!
===================

This project is now deprecated in favour of https://github.com/picoDoc/betfair-data-capture
